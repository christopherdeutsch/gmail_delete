This is just a quick hack to download and then delete old email from gmail.

I couldn't find any simple command-line programs to do this when I googled
for it, so I whipped one up. I'm releasing it so that the next person who
wants to do this hopefully gets better search results :)

Example usage:

Use the --days option to archive everything older than 30 days:

	gmail_delete.py --delete=true --days=30 --mbox=archive.mbox --username=<user>

Use the --purge flag to delete everything in a folder without archiving it:

	gmail_delete.py --purge=true --folder='[Gmail]/Trash' --username=<user> --password=<password>
